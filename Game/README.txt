Here's my vision as to how I want this game to turn out:
Have you ever played Duck Life? If not, go play any of them right now.

This game was inspired by duck life, but is more simple.

For graphics purposes, I'm using a rotating disc.

You have three abilities you can train:
    Speed (how fast your disk moves)
    Force (how quickly your disc breaks through walls)
    Agility (how quickly your disc avoids obstacles)

Minigames:
    Speed:
        (This is the game I'm least certain about. I wanted to make it different than any of the Duck Life ones)
        Player rolls back and forth quickly because the ground falls out behind you and can cause you to drop if you're too slow.
        Once the player gets to a red marking on the ground, they change direction and the ground starts falling/disappearing the other way
        Points awarded for how many times they go back and forth.
        
    Force:
        (This seems like the easiest one to program, so that's what I'm going to work on first)
        Player uses right arrow to charge down path and press space when over red zones for extra boosts.
        Points awarded for their final speed when hitting the wall at the end
    
    Agility:
        (Second easiest to program)
        Much like the second "running" minigame in Duck Life 4, the player has to dodge items that fall from the sky
        But, there are other things that come from the ground or the sides that cause them to move side to side, jump, or not jump.
        
Then, there are also competitions.
But the thing is, instead of playing against a computer that acts the same every time, we can play against each other!
So we can develop courses with timing based on skills and then see who takes the longest to complete a certain course.
