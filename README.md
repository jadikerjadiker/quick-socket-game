# quick-socket-game
A collab game made with my friends for my friends (or other people who like it)

The code is in the folder called Game.

The Cloud9Tutorial shows a much more complicated way to do essentially the same thing that we have implemented in Game.

To run it, go into the Game folder, run "index.js" and wait until it prints "listening on *:8080".
Then, go to https://quick-socket-game-jadiker.c9users.io  (there's also a link at the top of the terminal where you ran "index.js")

At the time of writing (6/29/16) you should be able to type in a username, hit submit,...
and be presented with a circle that can move around with the arrow keys.

If there's only one person online, it won't look like you're moving (since there's no background).
So,  I recommend creating a few tabs of people with different names and moving around so you can see how it works.
